      ### Why is modern web development so complicated?

      **There are more choices in tech than ever**, and with it comes more questions and more complexity.

      Have you ever thought:

      * "It was so easy to get started, but **now it takes forever to change anything**!"
      * "Why do I have to write **so much boilerplate**?"
      * "How do **so many bugs make it to production**?"
      * "Why is my app **so slow**!?"
      * "Why do I have to choose between fast prototyping and long term maintainability?"

      Every performance issue and every bug steals precious time from making your service better.

      ### What if you could get something up quickly *and* maintain it for years to come?

      Imagine this:

      * Generators for quick code creation
      * (Optional) Built in authentication
      * Secure by default
      * (Optional) Built in web pack config to get an SPA off the ground fast
      * Insanely fast execution so users arenâ€™t left waiting
      * Powerful type system that helps catch bugs before they ever hit production
